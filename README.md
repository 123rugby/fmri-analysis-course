# fMRI data analysis course

Materials for *fMRI data analysis* course tought at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ
for cognitive science students (including freshmans). The original course was called 
*Advanced fMRI data analysis course* but it rather contains fundamental topics in fMRI 
data analysis. The "advanced" part refers to using Python and scripts (not GUI's) 
over entire classes.

### The Hogwart's way of teaching
The goal of the course was to introduced topics of fMRI data analysis, reproducibility, 
Python, and version control, in an accessible way, giving students a lot of **FUN**  and 
freedom. I called the way of teaching the course *the Hogwart's way*.
It also refers to the fact that for most participants, the fMRI data analysis, 
python programming, version control etc. was like a magic at the beginnning of the course. 
Tha most important goal of the course was to reduce the initial fear of trying something 
entirely new, which is in fact quite complex.

How to become *neuroinfomagician*?
