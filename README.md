# fMRI data analysis course

Materials for *fMRI data analysis* course taught at [Nicolaus Copernicus University](https://www.umk.pl/en/) in Toru≈Ñ
for cognitive science students (including first-year students). The original course was called 
*Advanced fMRI data analysis course* but it rather contains fundamental topics in fMRI 
data analysis. The "advanced" part refers to using Python and scripts (not GUI's) 
over entire classes.

### The Hogwarts way 
I called the way of teaching the course *the Hogwarts way*. It refers to the fact 
that for most participants, the fMRI data analysis, python programming, version control, etc. was like magic at the beginning of the course.
The goal of the course was to introduce topics of fMRI data analysis, reproducibility, 
Python, and version control, giving students a lot of **FUN**  and freedom. 
 

The most important goal of the course was to reduce the initial fear of trying something 
entirely new, which is, in fact, quite complex. 


:warning: **Content warning**:
The course includes a lot of *Harry Potter* content not suitable for muggles 
and too serious people.

### How to become *neuroinfomagician*?
